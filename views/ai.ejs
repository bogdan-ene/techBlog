            <h1 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-4">Understanding Artificial Intelligence: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>
            <p class="text-lg mb-4">Artificial intelligence (AI) has become one of the most transformative technologies of the 21st century, shaping the way we interact with machines and changing the landscape of various industries. With its growing impact on our daily lives, it's important to grasp the fundamentals of AI and its applications.</p>
            <p class="text-lg mb-4">AI refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines, enabling them to perform tasks that typically require human intelligence. It involves the creation of intelligent agents that can perceive their environment and take actions to achieve specific goals. AI has found applications in diverse fields such as healthcare, finance, transportation, and entertainment, revolutionizing the way we live and work.</p>
            <h2>Types of Artificial Intelligence</h2>
            <h4>1. Narrow AI (Weak AI)</h4>
            <p>Narrow AI, or weak AI, is designed to perform a specific task and operates within a limited context. Examples include virtual personal assistants, recommendation algorithms, and image recognition software. These systems can excel in their designated areas but lack general cognitive abilities.
            </p>
            <h4>2. General AI (Strong AI)
            </h4>
            <p>General AI, or strong AI, is the hypothetical concept of a machine with the ability to understand, learn, and apply knowledge in a manner similar to human intelligence. It would have the capacity to handle complex tasks, reason, and solve problems, potentially surpassing human cognitive capabilities.
            </p>
            <h4>3. Artificial Superintelligence
            </h4>
            <p>Artificial superintelligence (ASI) is an advanced form of AI that surpasses human intelligence in every aspect. This theoretical AI system would have the ability to outperform humans in various fields, leading to groundbreaking advancements and potentially reshaping the future of humanity.
